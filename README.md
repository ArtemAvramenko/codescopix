## Creation
Codescopix was created using [Bits'N'Picas](https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas), a bitmap font editor.

## Help Needed: Generating a 16px Font Size
Currently, I am facing a challenge in generating a 16px font size using the Bits'n'Pics tool. At the moment, the tool only allows me to select parameters that output a 14px font. This presents a problem because 14px translates to 10.5 pt, a size that is not universally selectable in all text editors and IDEs. Having a standard 16px (12 pt) font size is crucial for better compatibility and readability across various platforms.

### The Issue
- **Current Output**: 14px font size (10.5 pt).
- **Desired Output**: 16px font size (12 pt).
- **Problem**: 10.5 pt is not a standard size and may not be selectable in many text editors and IDEs.

### How You Can Help
If you have experience with Bits'n'Pics or similar font creation tools, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in configuring the tool to output a 16px font size. Any guidance, suggestions, or tips on achieving this would be immensely helpful.
